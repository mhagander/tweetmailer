To make this thing work, you need a tweetmailer.ini file
that contains something along the line of:


[twitter]
user = <something>
consumer=<from twitter>
consumersecret=<from twitter>
token=<from twitter>
secret=<from twitter>

[email]
from = example@example.com
to = example@example.com



Note that you need to register yourself with the twitter developer
console, and get the secrets and tokens from there.
